"""Tests for core.database_bridge.DatabaseBridge.

DatabaseBridge is the sync facade main.py actually calls: it runs a
background asyncio event loop in its own thread and blocks the calling
thread (often the wx UI thread) on every call. Before this session it had no
timeout at all, so a stuck coroutine froze the entire app forever — the most
commonly reported "ZappInfinit parou de responder" symptom. These tests cover the
timeout and the close()-race-safety this session added, using the real
background-thread bridge (not mocked) against a temporary on-disk database.
