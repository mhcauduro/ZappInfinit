"""Tests for the "Sair" (Exit) shutdown wait.

Reported live: after the WPPConnect graceful-shutdown fix (waiting for Chrome
to close cleanly instead of taskkill /F /T'ing it immediately, to avoid
corrupting the linked-device credentials in its LevelDB profile — see
_stop_wpp_server()'s own docstring), clicking "Sair" made ZappInfinit's window sit
there tagged "Not Responding" by Windows for tens of seconds before actually
closing.

Two compounding bugs, both here:

1. real_exit() called _stop_wpp_server() directly on the wx main thread. That
   method can legitimately block for the whole graceful-stop budget (an HTTP
   request plus a poll loop) — which stops the message loop from pumping for
   that whole time, and Windows marks any window whose message loop goes quiet
   for a few seconds as "Not Responding". real_exit() must never call it
   synchronously.

2. The HTTP request and the poll loop after it each had their OWN full budget
   (25s + 25s = 50s worst case) instead of sharing one. Even off the main
   thread, a 50s wait to quit is bad on its own merits.
