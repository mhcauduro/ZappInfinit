"""Tests for whether a stored WPPConnect token may be reused for a new pairing.

_bg_pairing_flow() persists WA_token as soon as WPPConnect emits a pairing code
— well before the pairing completes. The reuse check used to accept any stored
token for a matching number, which broke the cancel-and-retry flow outright:

  1. "Continuar" → code ABCD1234 appears, WA_token is persisted.
  2. "Cancelar pareamento" → cleanup_pairing_session() calls /close-session and
     WPPConnect drops that token from clientsArray.
  3. "Continuar" again → the stale token still matched, so the flow reused it
     and called /start-session on a session that no longer existed. No code was
     ever emitted; the dialog sat on "Conectando..." for the full 90 s wait.

The same applies when the app is killed mid-pairing, where no cleanup runs at
all. Requiring `paired` — which is only ever set once WhatsApp is genuinely
linked — is what separates "a session worth reusing" from "a token left over
from an attempt that never finished".

Connect is a plain class, so the check is exercised directly.
