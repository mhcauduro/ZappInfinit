"""client/api_patches/ and client/api/ must never drift apart.

client/api/ is almost entirely git-ignored, but .gitignore deliberately
un-ignores exactly ZappInfinit's patched files, because a fresh checkout (including
the CI release build) otherwise has nothing to restore and silently ships
vanilla, unpatched WPPConnect Server.

That leaves two copies of every patch on disk, and setup_api.py restores
client/api/ *from* client/api_patches/. So editing only the client/api/ copy
looks like it works — until the next setup_api.py run silently reverts it.
That is exactly what happened to start.js: commit daf2d352 added the npx-cli.js
resolution fallback (needed on machines with no system-wide Node) to
client/api/start.js only, and re-running setup_api.py threw it away.

These tests compare the two copies byte for byte so the same mistake fails
here instead of in a user's install.

package.json is deliberately NOT compared: setup_api.py merges only
_PATCHED_DEPENDENCY_KEYS into whatever the clone produced (so WPPConnect's own
"version" field keeps reflecting the tag actually built) and re-serializes the
file, so the two copies legitimately differ. Its one patched dependency
(@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg) is checked instead — and, separately,
@wppconnect-team/wppconnect is checked to confirm it is deliberately NOT
patched: that pin used to be forced to an exact version ("2.2.4") that went
stale within days, because this dependency releases multiple times a week —
wppconnect-server's own package.json had already moved on to requiring a newer
one than what ZappInfinit had frozen, silently running an incompatible pairing.
fluent-ffmpeg used to be patched too, and was never imported anywhere by
anything — it is checked to confirm it stays gone from every file.
