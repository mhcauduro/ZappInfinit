"""Tests for where a chat's display identity comes from.

Two independent defects made conversations disappear from the list entirely.
Both were measured on a real 539-chat account that showed only 323 rows:

1. list-chats returns each individual chat with a nested `contact` block
   (name/shortName/pushname) and nothing read it, so every individual chat was
   stored and rendered nameless — 124 of 263 chats had a usable name in that
   block, 0 of 263 reached the database with one.

2. _compute_chat_lists() dropped a chat as "no content and no identity" using
   only the raw dict's name/pushName, ~30 lines *before* it called
   _resolve_contact_name(). WhatsApp Web returns `msgs: null` in list-chats, so
   lastMessage is empty for every chat right after a sync; any chat that also
   had no unread count was dropped before its name was ever looked up, even
   though all 263 had a matching contact record.

_lift_contact_identity covers (1) and is tested directly. (2) is a reordering
inside a large wx-bound method, so the decision it now makes is reproduced here
against the same inputs.
