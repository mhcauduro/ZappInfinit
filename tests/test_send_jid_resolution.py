"""Tests for the JID resolution used by the outgoing-message paths.

These cover the "ZappInfinit says sent, nothing arrives on the phone" bug: private
sends were addressed to the legacy ``<phone>@c.us`` JID even for chats WhatsApp
has moved to LID addressing.  WhatsApp Web happily creates the message there and
hands back a real ``3EB0…`` id — so the HTTP call looks successful — but the
server never acks it (``ack`` stays 0/CLOCK) and it reaches neither the phone nor
the recipient.  Groups were unaffected, since ``@g.us`` is canonical everywhere.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated without a running app, so
the methods under test are exercised as plain functions against a small stub
that carries just the attributes they touch.
