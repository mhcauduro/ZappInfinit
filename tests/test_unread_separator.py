"""Tests for where the unread separator is placed and when it goes away.

Two separate reports, both about the same row:

1. "Mensagens próprias contam como não lidas" — messages sent from the phone or
   another linked device were being announced as unread when the conversation
   was opened in ZappInfinit. WhatsApp's ``unreadCount`` only ever counts messages
   you *received*, but the separator was placed at ``len(displayable) -
   unread_count``, which counts your own messages too. See first_unread_index().

2. The separator vanished on a 2-second timer armed as soon as focus reached it,
   so it disappeared while the user was still sitting on it. It now goes away
   only once focus actually moves past it. See
   ConversationsPanel._should_dismiss_unread_separator().

ConversationsPanel is a wx.Panel and cannot be instantiated without a running
wx.App, so the method under test is exercised as a plain function — same
approach as tests/test_message_bookmarks.py.
