"""Tests for the WhatsApp socket-stream nudge fired when status-session says
CONNECTED but the live isConnected() probe disagrees.

Reported live: after the OS resumes from sleep, ZappInfinit got stuck offline
forever — status-session kept reporting the WPPConnect session object as
"CONNECTED" (a value cached at session creation), but check_whatsapp_reachable()
(the live isConnected() probe) never came back true again, and nothing ever
retried it. Root cause: WhatsApp Web's own multi-device socket is normally
reopened via WPP.whatsapp.Cmd.openSocketStream(), triggered by the page's own
visibility/focus/online DOM events — a headless, never-focused Chrome page
never fires those on its own after a suspend/resume cycle, so the socket that
went down during sleep had no trigger left to reconnect it.

MainWindow._nudge_whatsapp_socket_stream() POSTs to a new WPPConnect endpoint
(reconnect-socket-stream) that calls that same internal command directly.
check_wa_connection_http() now calls it exactly once whenever it detects the
CONNECTED-but-unreachable mismatch, before falling back to offline mode.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated without a running wx.App,
so the method under test is exercised as a plain function against a small
stub — same approach as tests/test_message_bookmarks.py.
