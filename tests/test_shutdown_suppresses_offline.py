"""Tests for MainWindow._set_wa_connected() ignoring connection-state
transitions once the app has started shutting down.

Reported live: quitting via Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q announced "modo offline
ativado" (sound + speech) right before the process exited.
_stop_wpp_server() (called from real_exit()) POSTs /close-session to shut
WhatsApp Web down cleanly — but while ZappInfinit's own WebSocket is still
connected, that arrives as an ordinary "connection.update state=close"
event, indistinguishable at that layer from WhatsApp genuinely dropping
the connection. _shutting_down, set at the very top of real_exit(), makes
_set_wa_connected() — the single entry point for every connection-state
transition — a no-op once quitting has started.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and cannot be instantiated without a running
wx.App, so _set_wa_connected() is exercised as a plain function against a
minimal stub — same approach as tests/test_sender_names.py. The stub
deliberately carries almost no attributes: if the shutdown guard doesn't
return immediately, touching any of the real method's other logic would
raise AttributeError, itself proof the guard didn't fire.
