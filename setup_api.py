ZappInfinit — WPPConnect Server setup script.

Clones the WPPConnect Server repository into client/api/ and optionally checks
out a specific tag. After cloning, follow the build instructions printed at
the end to compile the API before running build.py.

Configuration (via .env at the project root):
  WPPCONNECT_TAG_VERSION  — git tag to check out after cloning.
                            Leave unset or empty to keep the default branch (main).

Usage:
  venv\\Scripts\\python.exe setup_api.py

# @wppconnect-team/wppconnect used to be pinned here too, to an exact version
# ("2.2.4") that predated this comment. That went stale fast: this dependency
# releases new patch versions multiple times a week, and wppconnect-server's
# own main branch had already moved on to requiring "^2.2.6" — meaning a fresh
# clone/build was running WPPConnect Server against an @wppconnect-team/wppconnect
# release two patches behind what it was actually written and tested against,
# silently, with no error anywhere.
#
# The fix is to not patch it at all: leave upstream's own declared range in
# package.json exactly as the clone/checkout produced it, the same way every
# OTHER unpinned dependency already works here. @wppconnect/wa-js and
# @wppconnect/wa-version are never pinned by ZappInfinit either — they are pulled
# in transitively through whatever @wppconnect-team/wppconnect version resolves,
# so they now track the paired version automatically instead of needing to be
# kept in sync by hand. This mirrors start.js's own resolveWhatsappVersion(),
# which resolves the WhatsApp Web build version dynamically for exactly the
# same reason ("Rather than hardcoding a version — which rots...").
