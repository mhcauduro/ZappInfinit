# Changelog (ZappInfinit Fork)

All notable changes to this fork of ZappInfinit are documented in this file.

# V2026.06.21.1555

## Bug Fixes
* **Auto-Updater Path Warning:** Fixed the incorrect warning log statement indentation in `updater.py` so it only runs on unsupported platforms.
* **Process Tree Cleanup:** Modified `real_exit()` and `_stop_evolution()` to explicitly kill the entire WPPConnect Server Node.js/Chromium process tree on Windows using `taskkill /F /T`, preventing orphaned processes and releasing all file locks for auto-updater overwrites.
* **PTT Audio Playback (Opus):** Loaded the `bassopus` and `bass_aac` plugins during BASS startup in `sound_system.py` to support playing WhatsApp Opus-encoded voice notes (`.ogg`) and AAC attachments.
* **Message Status Filtering:** Fixed `_map_status()` to display status ticks (sent, delivered, read) only on messages sent by you (`fromMe`). Incoming received messages will no longer display these ticks (unless the audio was played).

# V2026.06.21.1450

## Upstream Synchronization & Merge
* **PyQt/wxPython Upstream Enhancements:** Merged upstream PyQt/wx client UI enhancements, including the new playing voice note audio controls visualization in the conversations list.
* **WPPConnect Mentions Integration:** Integrated the new upstream `@mention` suggestion panel and `mentioned_jids` arguments in `send_text_message` with WPPConnect Server's `/api/:session/send-mentioned` routing (with robust fallback to standard sending on failure).
* **Silent Disconnection Handling:** Replaced blocking error popups during transient network disconnections with silent status bar notifications and automatic Socket.IO reconnection loops to prevent UI freezes.
* **Debounced Data Saves:** Coalesced rapid message writes using a thread-safe `_save_lock` and a `150ms` debounced timer (`_schedule_save`) to prevent `messages.dat` file corruption during bulk syncs.
* **Accessibility Overrides (NVDA):** Preserved local list focus and selection guards (e.g. clearing focus state before DeleteAllItems) to prevent stuttering and COM errors on screen readers.

# V2026.06.20.0312

## Port Refactor
* **Port Uniformity:** Changed the default local API port from `3417` to `6300` in client configurators, settings menus, and startup launchers to align with local WPPConnect Server setups.

---

# V2026.06.18.1742

## @lid JID Name Resolution & Caching
* **Background LID to Phone Resolution:** Implemented background queries utilizing `/contact/fetchProfile` to map linked device JIDs (`@lid`) to real phone numbers and contact names, resolving blank contacts.
* **Local Mapping Cache:** Added a local JID mapper cache (`_lid_to_phone` and `_phone_to_lid`) that is encrypted and stored in `messages.dat` on shutdown.
* **Real-time Chat Merging:** Implemented real-time message merging and unread count accumulation, deduplicating and merging `@lid` chats directly into `@s.whatsapp.net` entries at startup and on incoming events.
* **Placeholder Name Filtering:** Prevented resolved placeholders (e.g. "Contato sem nome") from overwriting valid contact names.
* **Brazilian 9-Digit Interchangeability:** Added support for matching phone numbers with and without the 9th digit interchangeably.

## Contact Synchronization Overhaul
* **Contact Update Merging:** Replaced raw contact overwrites with safe merging (`self.contacts.update`) to prevent active background syncs from wiping out previously resolved contact names.
* **Selective Contact Queries:** Reverted the contact download endpoint to GET `/contact/findContacts` and integrated selective incremental updates to minimize API overhead.
* **Contact Type Filtering:** Explicitly filtered contact list data by `type == contact` to keep parity with the original codebase.

## Startup & WebSocket Stability
* **Connection State Verification:** Implemented a direct HTTP connection query during client initialization to resolve startup race conditions and prevent redundant websocket connections.
* **Registry Autostart Synchronization:** Synced the Windows registry autostart keys with client configuration options on startup to prevent duplicate prompts during reinstallations.
* **Archived Status Sync:** Synchronized chat archives status changes via websocket `chats.update` events and local settings during normalization.
* **Log Redirection:** Redirected all evolution logs to the client logs directory.
* **Platform Guards:** Guarded Windows-specific `ctypes` and subprocess flags behind platform checks to support safer multi-platform script execution.

# V2026.06.17.2340

## WebSocket & API Connection
* **Evolution API WebSocket Activation:** Configured `WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=true` and `WEBSOCKET_GLOBAL_EVENTS=true` in the local launcher (`start.js`) to ensure the Socket.IO server initializes correctly, resolving `404 Not Found` connection failures during client startup.

## Maximum Verbosity Logging ("logs no talo")
* **Deep Level Logging (DEBUG):** Upgraded the entire Python client log level to `DEBUG` and redirected all standard output (`sys.stdout`) to `logging.DEBUG` to capture every print.
* **Network & WebSocket Tracing:** Explicitly forced all HTTP (`requests`, `urllib3`) and Socket.IO/Engine.IO loggers to `DEBUG` level.
* **Full Socket.IO Packet Logging:** Enabled `logger=True` and `engineio_logger=True` on the Socket.IO client constructor to record all incoming/outgoing websocket packets, events, payload contents, and keep-alive heartbeats.

# V2026.06.17.2228

## Critical App Bug Fixes
* **Connection Initialization Crash:** Resolved a startup crash (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'state')`) by applying a defensive patch to the Baileys auth state and enabling PostgreSQL local database persistence by default.
* **Force Update Feedback:** Fixed silent failures during manual update checks (Help > Force Update) to display a dialog explaining the network error or GitHub rate limits.

## Database & API Integration
* **Local Database Persistence:** Enabled database saving by default in the API boot script (`start.js`) so that instance credentials and chat history persist correctly in PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_SAVE_DATA_INSTANCE=true`).
* **Automated Patching:** Integrated all Baileys and Evolution API patch scripts (quoted context, pairing time, mark read, auth state) into the automated GitHub Actions release workflow.

## Client Logging System
* **Persistent Logs:** Added a client logging module writing to `logs/log.log` to track runtime traces, request errors, and detailed updater exception tracebacks for troubleshooting.

## CI/CD & Automation
* **Workflow Concurrency Control:** Added concurrency settings in GitHub Actions to automatically cancel any in-progress runs when a new push is received, preventing duplicate builds and race conditions.

---

# V2026.06.17.2208

## CI/CD & Automation
* **Automated Release Pipeline:** Implemented a full GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) running on Windows Server to compile and publish ready-to-run releases on every push to the `main` branch.
* **Date-Based Versioning:** Switched to automatic UTC date/time versioning (`YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM`, e.g., `2026.06.17.2208`) to prevent loop updates.
* **Structured Action Caches:** Added cache scopes for MSYS2, Python pip dependencies, Node.js binaries, and `node_modules` to speed up remote compilation.

## User Interface
* **Interface Cleanup:** Removed the "What's New" dialog (`WhatsNewDialog`) and changelog buttons from the updater interface to streamline startup.

---

# V0.11.0.1

## Auto-Updater System
* **GitHub Release Integration:** Re-engineered the updater to query GitHub Releases API directly, fetching tags and release notes natively without needing extra files.
* **File Lock Resolution:** Added dynamic process termination routines in the updater script to close PostgreSQL (port 5433) and Evolution API (port 6300) connections, preventing "Access Denied" errors during files overwrite.

## Compilation & Packaging
* **PyInstaller Migration:** Replaced the legacy Nuitka compiler with PyInstaller (`build.py`) for builds packaging.
* **Library DLL Bundling:** Restructured packaging of critical dynamic sound DLLs (BASS) and screen readers (`accessible-output2`) to prevent runtime crashes.
* **Custom Installer Stub:** Optimized the C stub installer (`installer.c`) to extract payload files and register uninstallation entries on Windows.

## Development Setup
* **Dependencies Preservation:** Updated `setup_api.py` to preserve the `node_modules` folder, maintaining a local NPM cache during checkout operations.

---

# V0.10.0.0

## Client Stabilization
* **Dialogue Error Fix:** Fixed an `AttributeError` in the connection dialog (`connection_dial`) occurring during WebSocket disconnections.
* **LID JID Compatibility:** Added support for linked device JIDs (`@lid`), resolving blank contact and conversation names.
* **Group Formatting:** Prevented group JIDs from being incorrectly parsed as standard phone numbers.
* **Updater Redirection:** Updated all download endpoints to target `mhcauduro/ZappInfinit`.
